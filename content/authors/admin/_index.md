Welcome! I am Marius, and I'm a post doc in political data science.

My research revolves around the dimensions of political conflict. What issues matter for the public, political parties and
their constituencies? To answer these questions I study political communication of legislators, parties and other key political actors. 

My dissertation is about how political elites use social media: are they using it to signal their positions and priorities to the electorate? Are they influenced by the medium itself?

Beyond that I am also interested in public opinion, in particular how to measure preferences of voters and social media users.
